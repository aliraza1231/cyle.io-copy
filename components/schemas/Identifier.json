  "description": "A human-readable identifier used to refer to a resource, where using the official ID may be inconvenient.\nThe identifier is automatically tokenized from the name/relevant field of the resource if one is not provided. For example, a container named \"My Container\" will\nhave the identifier of `my-container` and is automatically created by the platform.\n\nThe identifier does not have to be unique.\n"

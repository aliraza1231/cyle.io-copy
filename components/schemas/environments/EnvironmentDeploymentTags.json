  "description": "A map of custom tags to deployment versions. Allows for defining a custom, persistent tag with a changing version number. \nFor example, `dev -> v1.2.3-dev`. This is useful when dealing with DNS LINKED records, where you always want dev.example.com to point to the \n`dev` version of your app within an environment, where you can continuously deploy and update it without needing to change the record. It is \neven more useful when you have multiple LINKED records, and you update i.e. `prod`` tag to point to a new version, all records using the `prod` tag\nare switched at once.\n",
